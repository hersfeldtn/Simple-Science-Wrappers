# Simple-Science-Wrappers

A repository of very simple python wrappers intended for people who want to use obscure bits of scientific software but have zero idea how to code. It's just the one wrapper for now but I'm sure I'll do more in the future. Part of my [Worldbuilding Pasta](https://worldbuildingpasta.blogspot.com/) project.

Each wrapper will include the python script for reference and a standalone .exe made using PyInstaller

Wrappers included for:

### [planetsynth](https://github.com/tiny-hippo/planetsynth)

Determine the radius, luminosity, effective temperature, and surface gravity of gas giant planets based on their mass, composition, irradiation, and age.
